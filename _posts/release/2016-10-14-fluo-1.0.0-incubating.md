Apache Fluo 1.0.0-incubating is the first release of Fluo as an Apache project and the fourth
release for the project. Below are resources for this release:

Starting with 1.0.0-incubating, Apache Fluo will follow [semver](http://semver.org/) for all future API
changes. The API consists of everything under the `org.apache.fluo.api` package. Code outside of this
package can change at any time. If your project is using Fluo code that falls outside of the API,
then consider [initiating a discussion](/contactus/) about adding it to the API.

## Significant changes

The 1.0.0-incubating release includes [167 commits][commits] that were made since the last release 
(1.0.0-beta-2).  The significant changes are summarized below. For information about changes
before this release, see the [archive](/pre-asf-release/) of Fluo releases before becoming an Apache
project.

#### Stabilized API 

Starting with this release, Apache Fluo's API will follow [semver].  The API is defined as
everything under the org.apache.fluo.api Java package.  Given that the plan is to support this API
for a long time, a lot of API improvements were made since the beta-2 release.  The following is a
list of significant API changes since beta-2.

 * [#772][772] : Get with default
 * [#770][770] : Use varargs for Columns
 * [#768][768] : Made Obsever and Application configuration consistent
 * [#743][743] : Make data classes final
 * [#723][723] : Removed FluoAdmin.InitOps()
 * [#714][714] : Use Charsequence in API
 * [#695][695] : Removed all 3rd party types from API
 * [#680][680] : Changed package prefix from io.fluo to org.apache
 * [#647][647] : Added Oracle and Worker to API
 * [#639][639] : Improved scanning API
 * [#626][626] : Added operation to get row+column pairs.  Further improved by [#758][758].
 * [#119][119] - Consistently offer String in API

#### Configurable classpath

The previous releases of Fluo contained specific versions of Accumulo, Hadoop, Zookeeper, and other
Fluo dependencies.  However, the actual dependencies needed should be determined by the existing
version of software where Fluo is run.  Fluo changed to a model of making its classpath be
completely configurable by an administrator.  Example classpath configuration and download scripts
ship with Fluo to help make setup easier.  These script were only tested with specific versions of
Hadoop and Accumulo and may not work with all versions.  These changes were made in [#706][706] and
[#687][687]. 

#### New Fluo version command

Added a version command to the Fluo scripts in [#779][779].  This makes it easy to automatically
build shaded jars with the correct version of Fluo for use in Spark and Map Reduce.

#### User and historical metrics

Two major improvements related to metrics were made.  Support for user metrics was added by
[#767][767].  This allows observers to easily report application specific metrics.  In [#635][635]
the example InfluxDB and Grafana configurations were updated to show historical metrics.

#### Improved transaction processing

Transaction processing throughput was increased by changes in [#593][593] and some subsequent bug
fixes.   These changes moved commit processing from the threads executing user code to an
asynchronous background process.  This allows user threads to queue a transaction for commit an
immediately start working on another notification.  This new process allows many more transactions
to be working through the commit process concurrently.  Before the change a worker could only be
committing up to a few hundred transactions at any time.   After the change, a single worker could
easily be committing tens of thousands of transactions at a time.  These changes increase the latency of 
individual transactions, which can have some drawbacks [#650][650].   For this release changes were
made in [#654][654] to use a priority queue for notifications in the worker.  The changes in
[#654][654] partially solves the lock wait problem identified in [#650][650].

#### Improved Accumulo scanning

Fluo utilizes server side Accumulo iterators.  For this release these iterators were modified to
leverage seeking on the sever side.  Before these changes the iterators used to sequentially scan
data.  For popular cells that had a lot versions, this could be slow.  These changes were made in
[#623][623].

## Other changes of interest

* [#668][668] - Added method to append byte to BytesBuilder
* [#648][648] - Added documentation to help users if YARN is killing containers
* [#619][619] [#621][621] - Created Fluo logo

## Testing

A two day run of Webindex was started on September 7th using the latest snapshot version of Fluo.
This test used 11 EC2 m3.xlarge nodes.  The test ran without problem.   A good bit before that a [3
day run](/blog/2016/05/17/webindex-long-run-2/) of Webindex was conducted.
