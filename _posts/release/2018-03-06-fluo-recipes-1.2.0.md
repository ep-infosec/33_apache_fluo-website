title: Apache Fluo Recipes 1.2.0
version: fluo-recipes-1.2.0
---

Apache Fluo Recipes builds on the Apache Fluo API to provide libraries of common code for Fluo developers.
The 1.2.0 release is the first release of Fluo Recipes since Fluo graduated from Apache incubation. It has very
few changes from the 1.1.0-incubating release. If you are new to Fluo Recipes, you should use this release. If you
are already using Fluo Recipes 1.1.0-incubating, there is no reason to upgrade immediately.
