This page contains information on managing Fluo applications.

## Viewing data

When you have data in your Fluo application, you can view it using the command `fluo scan -a myapp`. 
Pipe the output to `less` using the command `fluo scan -a myapp | less` if you want to page through the data.

## Get status of all applications

To list all Fluo applications, run `fluo list`.

## Running application code

The `fluo exec <app name> <class> {arguments}` provides an easy way to execute application code. It
will execute a class with a main method if a jar containing the class is included with the observer 
jars configured at initialization. When the class is run, Fluo classes and dependencies will be on 
the classpath. The `fluo exec` command can inject the applications configuration if the class is 
written in the following way. Defining the injection point is optional.

```java
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class AppCommand {

  //when run with fluo exec command, the applications configuration will be injected
  @Inject
  private static FluoConfiguration fluoConfig;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    try(FluoClient fluoClient = FluoFactory.newClient(fluoConfig)) {
      //do stuff with Fluo
    }
  }
}
```

## Application Configuration

For configuring observers, fluo provides a simple mechanism to set and access application specific
configuration.  See the javadoc on [FluoClient].getAppConfiguration() for more details.

## Debugging Applications

While monitoring [Fluo metrics][metrics] can detect problems (like too many transaction collisions)
in a Fluo application, [metrics][metrics] may not provide enough information to debug the root cause
of the problem. To help debug Fluo applications, low-level logging of transactions can be turned on
by setting the following loggers to TRACE:

| Logger               | Level | Information                                                                                        |
|----------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fluo.tx            | TRACE | Provides detailed information about what transactions read and wrote                               |
| fluo.tx.summary    | TRACE | Provides a one line summary about each transaction executed                                        |
| fluo.tx.collisions | TRACE | Provides details about what data was involved When a transaction collides with another transaction |
| fluo.tx.scan       | TRACE | Provides logging for each cell read by a scan.  Scan summary logged at `fluo.tx` level.  This allows suppression of `fluo.tx.scan` while still seeing summary. |

Below is an example log after setting `fluo.tx` to TRACE. The number following `txid: ` is the
transactions start timestamp from the Oracle.

```
2015-02-11 18:24:05,341 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 3 begin() thread: 198
2015-02-11 18:24:05,343 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 3 class: com.SimpleLoader
2015-02-11 18:24:05,357 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 3 get(4333, stat count ) -> null
2015-02-11 18:24:05,357 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 3 set(4333, stat count , 1)
2015-02-11 18:24:05,441 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 3 commit() -> SUCCESSFUL commitTs: 4
2015-02-11 18:24:05,341 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 5 begin() thread: 198
2015-02-11 18:24:05,442 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 3 close()
2015-02-11 18:24:05,343 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 5 class: com.SimpleLoader
2015-02-11 18:24:05,357 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 5 get(4333, stat count ) -> 1
2015-02-11 18:24:05,357 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 5 set(4333, stat count , 2)
2015-02-11 18:24:05,441 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 5 commit() -> SUCCESSFUL commitTs: 6
2015-02-11 18:24:05,442 [fluo.tx ] TRACE: txid: 5 close()
```

The log above traces the following sequence of events.

* Transaction T1 has a start timestamp of `3`
* Thread with id `198` is executing T1, its running code from the class `com.SimpleLoader`
* T1 reads row `4333` and column `stat count` which does not exist
* T1 sets row `4333` and column `stat count` to `1`
* T1 commits successfully and its commit timestamp from the Oracle is `4`.
* Transaction T2 has a start timestamp of `5` (because its `5` > `4` it can see what T1 wrote).
* T2 reads a value of `1` for row `4333` and column `stat count`
* T2 sets row `4333` and column `stat count` to `2`
* T2 commits successfully with a commit timestamp of `6`

Below is an example log after only setting `fluo.tx.collisions` to TRACE. This setting will only log
trace information when a collision occurs. Unlike the previous example, what the transaction read
and wrote is not logged. This shows that a transaction with a start timestamp of `106` and a class
name of `com.SimpleLoader` collided with another transaction on row `r1` and column `fam1 qual1`.

```
2015-02-11 18:17:02,639 [tx.collisions] TRACE: txid: 106 class: com.SimpleLoader
2015-02-11 18:17:02,639 [tx.collisions] TRACE: txid: 106 collisions: {r1=[fam1 qual1 ]}
```

When applications read and write arbitrary binary data, this does not log so well. In order to make
the trace logs human readable, non ASCII chars are escaped using hex. The convention used it `\xDD`
where D is a hex digit. Also the `\` character is escaped to make the output unambiguous.
