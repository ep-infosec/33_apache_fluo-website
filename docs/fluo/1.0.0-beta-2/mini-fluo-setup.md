title:  MiniFluo Setup
version: 1.0.0-beta-2
---

Below are instructions for running a test/development instance of Fluo
called MiniFluo.  MiniFluo runs its own Accumulo and Zookeeper but can
only run on one machine.  While MiniFluo is easy to set up and has 
all of the features of Fluo, it is not recommended for production use as 
all of its data is lost when its stopped.

If you looking to run Fluo in a production environment, read the
[production setup instructions][prod-fluo].

Obtaining a distribution
------------------------

Before you can install MiniFluo, you will need to obtain a distribution tarball.  You
can either download the [latest release][release] or build a distribution tarball
by following these steps:

First, clone Fluo:

    git clone https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo.git
    cd fluo/

Optionally, check out a stable tag (if you don't want to build a release from main):

    git checkout 1.0.0-beta-2

Next, build a distribution which will be created in `modules/distribution/target`.

    mvn package

Install Fluo distribution
-------------------------

When you have a distribution tarball built for your environment, follow these steps
to install Fluo.

First, choose a directory with plenty of space and untar the distribution:

    tar -xvzf fluo-1.0.0-beta-2-bin.tar.gz

Verify that your distribution has the same versions of Hadoop & Accumulo as your environment:

    cd fluo-1.0.0-beta-2
    ls lib/hadoop-* lib/accumulo-*

Next, copy the example configuration to the base of your configuration directory to create
the default configuration for your Fluo install:

    cp conf/examples/* conf/

The default configuration will be used as the base configuration for each new application. 
Therefore, you should modify [fluo.properties] for your environment. However, you should
not configure any application settings (like observers).
 
As you are running a MiniFluo instance, most properties in [fluo.properties] do not need to be 
set by you. For example, all "Client properties" can be left unset as MiniFluo will start up 
its own Accumulo and Zookeeper.  If you would rather have MiniFluo connect to an existing 
Accumulo instance, change `io.fluo.mini.start.accumulo` to `false` and set all "Client properties".
If you have an existing Accumulo instance, you should also consider running a Fluo instance by 
following the [production setup instructions][prod-fluo].

MiniFluo command script
-----------------------

The MiniFluo command script is located at `bin/mini-fluo` of your Fluo installation.  All
MiniFluo commands are invoked by this script.

Modify and add the following to your `~/.bashrc` if you want to be able to execute the
`mini-fluo` script from any directory:

    export PATH=/path/to/fluo-1.0.0-beta-2/bin:$PATH

Source your `.bashrc` for the changes to take effect and test the script

    source ~/.bashrc
    mini-fluo

Running the script without any arguments prints a description of all commands.

Configure a MiniFluo application
--------------------------------

You are now ready to configure a MiniFluo application.  Use the command below to create the
configuration necessary for a new application.  Feel free to pick a different name (other
than `myapp`) for your application:

    mini-fluo new myapp

This command will create a directory for your application at `apps/myapp` of your Fluo
install which will contain a `conf` and `lib`.

The `apps/myapp/conf` directory contains a copy of the `fluo.properties` from your default
configuration.  This should be configured for your application:

    vim apps/myapp/fluo.properties

When configuring the observer section in [fluo.properties], you can configure your application
to run the [phrasecount] example if you have not developed your own application. See
the [phrasecount] example for instructions. You can also choose not to configure any
observers but MiniFluo will be idle when started.

The `apps/myapp/lib` directory should contain any observer jars for your application. If 
you configured [fluo.properties] for observers, copy any jars containing these
observer classes this directory.
 
Run a MiniFluo application
--------------------------

A MiniFluo application can be started with the following command:

    mini-fluo start myapp

The application will output its logs to `app/myapp/logs/` directory of your Fluo installation.

MiniFluo starts its own cluster of Accumulo and Zookeeper.  All data for this
cluster is written by default to `app/myapp/mini/` directory of your Fluo installation 
but this can be configured in `fluo.properties`.  Logs for underlying cluster
can be viewed in `mini/logs`.

Due to MiniFluo starting its own cluster, it generates and writes a `client.properties`
file to its data directory.  This file can be used by Fluo clients to connect
to the MiniFluo instance.

When you have data in your fluo instance, you can view it using the command `mini-fluo scan myapp`.
Pipe the output to `less` using the command `mini-fluo scan myapp | less` if you want to page 
through the data.

Stop a MiniFluo application
---------------------------

A MiniFluo application can be stopped by running the following command:

    mini-fluo stop myapp

If MiniFluo started its own Accumulo cluster, it will also remove the `mini/` data 
directory and any data in your instance will be lost.
